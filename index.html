          Howdy! I am a dedicated software engineer with a strong foundation in
          many coding languages and industry standard practices. A proud
          graduate of the University of Texas at Dallas, I hold a post-graduate
          certificate in machine learning and AI and am currently expanding my
          expertise with a certificate in full stack development. My journey has
          taken me from Texas to Japan and back, where I spent six months
          immersing myself in a new culture before returning to Austin to pursue
          a dynamic career in the tech industry. Driven by a passion for
          innovation, I am particularly interested in UX design, machine
          learning, AI, and full stack development. I am committed to continuous
          learning and professional growth, with a strong belief in the value of
          hard work and perseverance. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to
          the tech community while further developing my skills and knowledge.
          Outside of my professional endeavors, I am an active member of the
          Austin Tennis Club, regularly participating in social events and
          tournaments throughout the city. I also enjoy exploring Austinâ€™s
          natural beauty, playing video games, and attending EDM events. I am
          eager to expand my professional network, connect with like-minded
          individuals, and engage in opportunities that allow me to learn and
          grow both personally and professionally.
